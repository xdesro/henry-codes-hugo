Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!

My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.

I was part of something special. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?
